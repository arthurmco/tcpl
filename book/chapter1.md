# First chapter

In C, the code to print 'first program' is:

``` c++
main ()
{
printf("primeiro programa\n");
}
```

# GNU C for compilation
Compile command:

`gcc -ansi -Wall -pedantic -O3`

> The way you run this program depends on the system you're using. As a specific
> example, in the UNIX system, you need to create the source code in a file
> whose name finishes in ".c", like "first.c" and compile it with the command
>
> `cc first.c`
>
> If you don't make anything wrong, like forget a character or write something
> wrong, the compilation will happen silenciously, and will produce an
> executable file named `a.out`.
>
> Running it with the command
>
> `a.out`
>
> Will produce the output
>
> `first program`
>
> In other systems, the rules will be different, check with a specialist.

# Exercise 1-1

Run this program in your system. Experiment to let some parts out to see what
eror messages you get.
